<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm simon</h1>
<h3 align="center">Full-stack developer and Solution Architect for AWS services </h3>

In the depths of my four-year odyssey through the tempestuous seas of software engineering, I have journeyed far and wide— from the fervent heart 🔥 of startups to the sprawling domains of large enterprises, donning the mantle of IT support, to the hallowed halls 🏛 of award-winning agencies. In this grand voyage, not confined by the tangible realms of space, I have thrived both in the serene solitude of remote work 🌐 and the vibrant communal atmosphere of office settings 🏢, always seizing the reins of responsibility 🛡 and leaping beyond the temporal boundaries ⏳ set before me.

My soul's deepest fervor 🔥 is kindled by the art of full-stack development; it is in the intricate weaving of web experiences 🕸, the creation of engaging mobile applications 📱, and the meticulous crafting of APIs that I find my true calling 🌟. With a spirit eager to integrate and contribute across the myriad phases of each project, I embark upon this path with a relentless pursuit of excellence ✨ and a deep-seated desire to etch my essence into the digital fabric of our era.

In this epoch, where the digital realm increasingly mirrors the complexities and nuances of the human condition, I seek not merely to develop but to infuse each line of code with a fragment of my soul 💖, striving always to bridge the chasm between man and machine 🌉 with creations that resonate with the soul's yearning for beauty, utility, and connection 🌍.
